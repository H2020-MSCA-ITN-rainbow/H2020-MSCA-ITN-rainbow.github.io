      <h2>GRIT, briefly</h2>

      GRIT is short for General Robust Interface Tracking.</br>

      GRIT originates from the <a href="http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~janba/DSC-webpage/">DSC</a> method, and builds on
      the experiences gained from DSC.  </br>

      GRIT was conceived to overcome the sequential nature of the DSC method as well as the overhead in the DSC implementation. </br>

      GRIT is designed to support domain decomposition through a copy-and-replace sub-domain strategy.</br>

      GRIT eliminates the sequential control flow of the original DSC algorithm, by batching operations into categories.</br>

      GRIT is designed to support custom quality measures for all batch operations.</br>
